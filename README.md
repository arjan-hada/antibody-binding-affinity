**Key Takeaways**

ðŸ”¹ I finetune antibody specific and general protein language model for predicting binding affinity (Kd) between single-chain variable fragments (scFv) and the target the SARS-CoV-2 peptide.

ðŸ”¹ esm2_t33_650M_UR50D model demonstrated superior performance compared to antibody-specific language models, namely antiberta2-cssp, antiberta2, and ablang-H. Notably, while the performance of ablang-H lagged significantly behind, the remaining three models showed relatively comparable results. However, it is important to note, esm2_t33_650M_UR50D is larger, containing about 650 million parameters, whereas both antiberta2 and antiberta2-cssp have around 202 million parameters.

ðŸ”¹ My approach exceeded the original study's Spearman rho (0.64 vs ~0.50) on hold-out set using just a single model, as opposed to the original study's ensemble of 16 models. 

ðŸ”¹ Our model achieved a Spearman correlation of 0.4833 on the out-of-distribution assessment library, indicating a moderate positive correlation between predicted and actual binding affinities. In contrast, the published results showed a Spearman correlation of NaN, suggesting a lack of meaningful correlation in their predictions.
